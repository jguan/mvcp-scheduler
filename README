Scheduling tool for MVCP to manage recordings
===============

MVCP is a protocol for controlling video servers (see mvcp.pdf). ArdMSBSim is a Windows application that
emulates a video server using MVCP. In order to play a file, a connection is done to a port and ASCII text
commands are entered. An example is shown below. Start by executing the application ArdMSBSim in a command
window.

Now, you can try to record by writing telnet localhost 5250 in a separate command window:
UADD 10101		← returns a recording unit
LOAD U1 myfile	← load a unit with a file
CUER U1			← prepares the unit for recording
REC U1			← the file is recorded
STOP U1			← stop the recording
UNLD U1			← unloads the unit (file)
UCLS U1			← closes the unit

It is possible to have several connections to the same video server open at the same time. Try again, but this time
with an additional telnet session. Type MON in the new window. To simulate multiple video servers, you may start
multiple instances of ArdMSBSim, using different port numbers. –h shows the syntax help for ArdMSBSim.

This program using Perl POE module aims to manage recordings. It will listen to a port and translate
commands from the user to MVCP commands. In addition, the program will read a description file that contains the
names of the video servers and where they are found. An example of such a description file is shown below. It
contains the name of the video server, its IP address and its port:

prancen 127.0.0.1 5250
vixen 127.0.0.1 5251
comet 192.168.1.12 5250

This program will take two arguments – the path of the description file and the port number that the program listens
on. The commands to the port of the program have the following syntax:

RECORD priority server filename time

where server is the name in the description file, filename is the file that should be recorded (see LOAD) and time is
the length of the recording (in seconds). Priority is an integer 0-100, 100 is the highest. Example:

RECORD 10 vixen myfile 40

The time is the time between the REC and STOP commands to the video server. A video server can only record one
file at a time. Multiple recording requests from the user to the video server must be queued and executed in order,
first by priority, second by the time the request was issued. This program only needs to handle one command connection
at a time. With the example description file above, the communication would look like this:
